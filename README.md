<h3 align="center">This end-to-end data science project delves into the dynamics of Chicago's taxi industry </h3>

### Project Description: 
Firstly, the project examines taxi demand trends across different pickup community areas from 2016 to 2022, identifying areas with the highest trip counts and notable increases in demand. Secondly, it investigates the influence of factors such as competition, unforeseen events, and internal strategy development on taxi demand. Lastly, it examines the relationship between trip duration and various factors like trip miles, time of day, month of year, and day of the week over a six-year period, providing insights into the underlying patterns driving trip duration variations in Chicago.

### Dataset: 
- The datasets for taxi travels from 2016 to 2022 are available from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
- The CommAreas.csv file contains data associating community names with their corresponding pickup community area numbers.

### Table of contents:
- A. Data Cleaning
- B. Handling Outliers
- C. Descriptive Analysis - Q1. What pattern in taxi demand become evident when analyzing the pickup community areas between 2016 and 2022? Are there particular community areas experiencing notable increase in taxi demand?
- D. Descriptive Analysis - Q2. How have various factors (competition, unforseen event, internal strategy development) influence taxi demands?
- E. Regression Analysis - Q3. How does the variation in trip duration ('trip seconds') relate to changes in trip miles, the time of day, Month of Year, and the day of the week over the period of 6 years?
